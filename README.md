# Sudoku-Solver--DSA-Project
This project implements a Sudoku solver using the principles of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It employs backtracking and recursion to find the solution to any given Sudoku puzzle. It's a practical demonstration of how these algorithms can be applied to solve complex problems efficiently.
